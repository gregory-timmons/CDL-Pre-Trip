                    <p class="step__action">Choke the wheels so the vehicle does't roll away.You will be releasing the parking brakes during the air leak test. Make sure you get into the cab with three points of contact.</p>

                    <p class="step__action">Put on Your seat belt. Make sure it is properly mounted and secure. It adjust properly, has no cuts or frays, and latches properly.Make sure you ask the examiner to but on their seat belt as well.</p>

                    <p class="step__action">Do a safe start. Put your foot on the brake, and make sure the vehicle is in neutral.Build pressure in the air tanks.Watch the primary and secondary air gauges ans listen for the governor to cut out somewhere between 120 - 140 psi. You should hear a "sneeze" when the governor cuts out.</p>

                    <h3 class="inspection-item">Static Leak -</h3>
                    <p class="step__action">With the air pressure built up to governor cutoff (120-140psi), shut off the engine.Turn the key to the "ON" position so that the gauges are operational.Release both the parking brakes and the trailer brakes.Let the air pressure equalize. Once it equalize's, time the air guage for one minute to make sure the air pressure drops no more than 3psi in one minute.</p>
                    <p class="step__content"></p>
                    <p class="step__note"><strong>Note:</strong>Make sure that the vehicle is off when checking for air leaks. You want the vehicle off because while the engine is on the air compressor is keeping the air storage tanks topped off.If the engine is running it will be masking any air leaks. Also make sure that you are releasing both the parking brakes.When you release the brakes (pushing in the knobs).If you don't release the brakes the air brake system will not have any air and you can't check for leaks.</p>

                    <h3 class="inspection-item">Applied Leak -</h3>
                    <p class="step__action">Apply the service brake. Time the air gauge for one minute and make sure the air pressure drops no more than 4psi in one minute.</p>

                    <p class="step__action">Fan the brakes down and make sure the low air pressure warning device comes on at or before 55psi.</p>

                    <p class="step__action">Fan the brakes until both the tracor and parking brakes pop out somewhere between 20 - 45psi.</p>
                    <p class="step__note"><strong>Note:</strong>You are testing your tractor protection valve, which is part of your emergency brake system.Reminder: the tractor protection valve protects the tractor air and ensures the trailer brakes apply if the air pressure drops too low.</p>
